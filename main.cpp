 Project 3 - Part 1 / 5
Video:  Chapter 2 Part 5
 User-Defined Types

 Create a branch named Part1

 Purpose: The entire purpose of this 5-part project is to get you writing C++ code that compiles and to reinforce the syntax habits that C++ requires.  What you create in this project will be used as the basis of Project 5 in the course.   
 
 1) write 10 user-defined types in plain-English, 
    in the comments above your UDT, write out, in plain-english, 3 things it can do, and 5 traits.
    Note: Your 10th UDT will use 5 of your UDTs for its properties, so maybe start on UDT #10 first. This goes along with instruction #6.
************************
    Commit after you complete this step so i can review before you proceed with the rest of the projects
    Ping me in Slack to review this step.
    Wait for me to review before proceeding with step 2.
************************
  
 2) define your struct for each of your 10 types. 
    Copy your 3+5 comments into your struct body.
    comment them out.
 
 3) declare your member variables and member functions underneath each plain-english comment in your struct's body.
    give the member variables relevant data types
 
 4) make the function parameter list for those member functions use some of your User-Defined Types
    You'll write definitions in part2 for these functions
    you'll call each of these functions in part3
 
 5) make 2 of the 10 user-defined types have a nested class.  
    this nested class also needs member functions.
    this nested class is not considered one of your 10 UDTs.
 
 6) One of your 10 UDTs should only use UDTs for its member variable types.   
    No primitives allowed!
    it still needs member variables.
 
 7) After you finish defining each type, click the [run] button.  Clear up any errors or warnings as best you can.
 
 Commit your changes by clicking on the Source Control panel on the left, entering a message, and click [Commit and push].
 
 Make a pull request after you make your first commit and pin the pull request link to our DM thread.

send me a DM to check your pull request

 Wait for my code review.
